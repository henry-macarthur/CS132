Goal root = new MiniJavaParser(system.in).Goal(); 
    gives a pointer to the goal node 
    we can access main class and the rest of the class 
    rest of pointers in the syntax tree 

TypecheckVisitor()
    this is where we right the type check


Strategy for hw2
    type check a single function 
        main class and main method 
        assignment statements and simple set of expressions 
    single main class and multiple functions 
    type checking for objects and classes (no inheritence)
        no subtyping allowed 
    allow subtyping 

do not need to worry about jtb and javacc, can get it as a library 
    located in lib 

SymbolTableVisitor 
    * methods and variables so we can build the symbol table 

expressions and statements would be under type checker 
we need visitors for everything when it comes to type checking 

symbol table 
    <id, type> is ok for basic table
